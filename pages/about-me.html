    <h1>MSc. MARTA ŁOSKOT</h1>
    <p>
      Ciao tutti! I am Marta and I am (very) Junior Frontend Developer, who is passionate about making world more
      beautiful and - as befits an engineer - simpler.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time I like learning italian, baking and as
      well as study Informatics at Silesian University of Technology (with not as much passion as making cakes, but
      still... ;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a list of some projects I have done, starting from easiest to
      hardest in chronological order.
